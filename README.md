# MovieAndTVShowsApplication
This application is designed on basis of following requirement
Design a backend API that allows users to search for movies and TV shows. Users should be able to search for content based on title, genre, and release year. The API should return a list of matching results, along with information such as the title, description, genre, release year, and ratings. Users should also be able to view more detailed information about a specific movie or TV show, such as the cast and crew, user reviews, and related content.

To implement this requirement, you can use a combination of different technologies and design patterns in Spring Boot, including:

RESTful API design using Spring Web
Database access using Spring Data JPA
Caching using Spring Cache
External API integration using Spring RestTemplate
API documentation using Springfox Swagger
Error handling using Spring MVC
You can also implement security features such as authentication and authorization using Spring Security, and use tools like Docker and Jenkins for deployment and continuous integration.
